This directory contains reference information needed to build the simulated ST data.  The _location_k.rds_ files
contain the (x,y) position of each location for each of the 12 OSCC samples.  The _pattern_patho_label_k.rds_
files contain the tissue layer information for each sample.

There are also two more files _Split_Puram_SCseq_Sims.Robj_ and _puram_data.rds_, which both contain the real 
scRNAseq data, that are too large to fit on GitHub.  They may be found on our [OSF](https://osf.io/kygsx/).
