This directory is a placeholder for the log directory you'll need to have on the HPC you use to run our code.  
The submission scripts (the _.sh_ files) will save what function as status updates to the log files, one for
each of the arrays in the job.  If something goes wrong, you'll want to check these log files to try to sort out the issue.
