This directory contains all code necessary to generate the simulated scRNAseq data with SPARSim.  The simulated data
is saved to the directory _scRNAseq_sim_data/_, though this is empty on GitHub as the files are too large.

For a short description of each file in this directory, see the Simulating the scRNA-seq data section of the 
README for the _Simulations/_ directory.
