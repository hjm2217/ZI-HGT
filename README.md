The ZI-HGT
================

## A Zero-Inflated Hierarchical Generalized Transformation Model to Address Non-Normality in Spatially-Informed Cell-Type Deconvolution

This GitHub repository contains instructions to use the ZI-HGT in your work and code to reproduce all figures, 
real data results, and simulation results from the paper _A Zero-Inflated Hierarchical Generalized Transformation Model to Address Non-Normality in 
Spatially-Informed Cell-Type Deconvolution_ by Hunter J. Melton, Jonathan R. Bradley, and Chong Wu.

## Using the ZI-HGT

We plan to eventually develop an R package for the ZI-HGT, but until then, please navigate to the _Instructions_for_use_ directory and follow the instructions to use the ZI-HGT.

## Replicating results from the manuscript

Please see the _Replication_ directory.
