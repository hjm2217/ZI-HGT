Unfortunately, the data files are too large for Github.  You can download them from our OSF ZI-HGT project found at our [OSF](https://osf.io/kygsx/?view_only=2876a9dec44e40a49de2d2a0b704acca).  The file organization on the OSF project matches the organization scheme here on GitHub, but you can find all of the large files that don't fit well here on OSF.
