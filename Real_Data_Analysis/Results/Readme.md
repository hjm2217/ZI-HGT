Unfortunately, the results files are also too large for Github. You can download them from our OSF ZI-HGT project found at https://osf.io/kygsx/?view_only=2876a9dec44e40a49de2d2a0b704acca. The file organization on the OSF project matches the organization scheme here on GitHub, but you can find all of the large files that don't fit well here on OSF.

We do include the results for applying the ZI-HGT + CARD to OSCC sample 1, plus the OSCC_min_WAIC_output.txt file so that example analysis may still be run using just what is here on GitHub.
