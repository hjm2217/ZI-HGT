# Figures_Code

This directory contains all code used to plot the figures in the manuscript.  Each individual file has instructions and 
code for prepping the results for the plot and for making the plot. Oftentimes the raw results are too big to store on
GitHub, but the prepared results will be. Any raw results not found here may be generated following the code
in the Real_Data_Analysis directory or Simulations directory, or they may be found on OSF.
